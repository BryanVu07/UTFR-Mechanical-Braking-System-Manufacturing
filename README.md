# UT24 UTFR-Mechanical-Braking-System-Manufacturing and Integration (Design Owner: UT24 Brakes Lead - Mo Taban)

## Overview
This README provides an overview of the key accomplishments and manufacturing processes involved in the development of the Mechanical Braking Systems for the University of Toronto Formula Racing (UTFR) team's competition vehicles. The braking system, originally designed by the UT24 Brakes Lead - Mo Taban, was further developed and refined through meticulous manufacturing and assembly processes.

## Achievements
- **1st Place** at the FSAE International Competition in New Hampshire.
- **9th Place** at the FSAE International Competition in Michigan.

## Manufacturing Process
- **Precision Machining:** Components for the Mechanical Braking Systems were manufactured and assembled using a Lathe and Mill, ensuring high precision with tolerances of Â±0.001''. This level of accuracy was critical in meeting the stringent requirements for competition.

## Key Features
- **High Tolerance Manufacturing:** Achieving tight tolerances was essential for the optimal performance and reliability of the braking system under competitive conditions.
- **Assembly and Integration:** The braking system components were meticulously assembled to ensure seamless integration and functionality within the overall vehicle design.

## Purpose
This project demonstrates the team's commitment to precision engineering and high-performance automotive design, contributing to the successful results at international competitions.
